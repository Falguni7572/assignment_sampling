# Assignment_sampling

After applying different method to balance the data, I decided upon oversampling using SMOTE. The sampling methods used are simple random sampling with and without replacement, systematic, stratified and cluster sampling. The models used to compare these sampling methods are logistic regression, random forest, SVM, K-nearest neighbours and XGBoost.
